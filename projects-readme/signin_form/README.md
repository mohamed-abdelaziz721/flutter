# 02 Sign in Form

This is the second lab which implements login layout using flutter.

> The whole work is done in the main.dart folder 
 
> TODO: In the upcoming implementations i will change the main.dart to act as a host page to all upcoming labs implementations
> I will make buttons to navigate through the app to the tasks implementations with separate screens directory for each task.
